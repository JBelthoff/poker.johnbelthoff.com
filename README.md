## About John Belthoff's Texas Holdem & Poker Hand Evaluator
This is a web project I started one day to see if I could re-create software to control a game of Texas Holdem Poker.  

The project is written using Microsoft Asp.Net in c# and totally relies on a port from c++ to c# of Cactus Kev's Poker Hand Evaluator. I have included a <a href="/cactus-kev2.html">copy of Cactus Kev's original article</a> on this site for convinience or so you can follow along.  

I have about 20-30 hours of real work into the program and at this point the game plays with 9 players, changes dealer, calculates the winning hand and displays the results.  

Certainly there is much more to programming to be done to achive a fully functional Texas Holdem Poker program, however I feel I have tackled the basics, or the main meat, of the challenge.  

The rest should be rather simple and straight forward.  

If you have any question please feel free to contact me anytime.  

Otherwise, Enjoy!
