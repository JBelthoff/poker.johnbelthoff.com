<h1>About John Belthoff's Texas Holdem Website</h1>
<p>This is a web project I started one day to see if I could re-create software to control a game of Texas Holdem Poker.</p>
<p>The project is written using Microsoft Asp.Net in c# and totally relies on a port from c++ to c# of Cactus Kev's Poker Hand Evaluator. I have included a <a href="/cactus-kev2.html">copy of Cactus Kev's article</a> on this site for convinience so you can follow along.</p>
<p>I have about 20-30 hours of real work into the program and at this point the game plays with 9 players, changes dealer, calculates the winning hand and displays the results.</p>
<p>Certainly there is much more to programming a fully functional Texas Holdem Poker program however I feel I have tackled the basic, or main meat, of the challenge. The rest is rather simple and straight forward. I will be tackling that in the near future from time to time updating the programming and making note here.</p>
<p>Otherwise, Enjoy!</p>
