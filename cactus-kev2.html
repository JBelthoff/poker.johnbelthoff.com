    A while ago, I decided to take a shot at writing a poker hand
    evaluator in the programming language "C".  There are already
    numerous evaluators out there, but I had an idea for an algorithm
    that might be faster than anything already out there.  The basic
    concept is to write a routine that would take a five card poker
    hand and return it's overall "value".  This is extremely valuable
    in any poker-related software, since the code will constantly be
    comparing various player's hand with each other to determine the
    "winner".  Here is my concept on how I thought I could write a
    fast evaluator.
    <hr width=60%>
    <font color=white size="-1">
        <i>
            Okay, before we start digging into my algorithm, please read
            this first.  I usually get one or two emails every month from
            somebody interested in my algorithm or poker code.  And they
            typically ask me if I happen to have a seven-card poker evaluator.
            The answer is yes.  I did indeed write a seven-card hand
            evaluator a few years after writing the five-card one.  It
            used a completely new algorithm, completely unrelated to my
            five-card version.  I just never posted it on my web site because
            (a) it was pretty lengthy, and (b) I was too lazy to write up
            all that HTML.<p>
                However, one day, I got an email from an actual poker software
                company from Canada called <a href="http://www.poker-academy.com/" rel="nofollow">
                    <b>Poker Academy</b>
                </a>.  They also wanted to know if I had written
                a seven-card evaluator, and if so, could they test it to see if it
                was faster than their current code?  We converted my code from 'C'
                to Java, and they gave it a whirl.  Turns out it was about three times
                faster than what they were currently using, so they asked if I'd
                be willing to sell/license it to their company for use in the next
                version of their software.  We worked out a contract and the deal
                was inked.  If you visit their site, download version 2.5, and select
                Version History, you can see my name in the notes for the February 15,
                2006 2.5.0 Release (b164).  The downside of all this, is that I cannot
                pass on my seven-card evaluator algorithm to any curious poker math-geeks
                who stumble upon my site.  So don't email me asking for the code or
                algorithm, because I can't give it to you.  Sorry, mate.

    <hr width=60% />
    First off, any person who has studied combinatorics will know
    that there are <font color=yellow><tt>C(52,5)</tt></font>,
    or 2,598,960 possible unique poker hands.
    I realized that even though there are nearly 2.6 million unique
    hands, many of those hands actually have the <i>same</i> poker
    hand value.  In other words, somebody holding an AJ942 flush in
    spades has the exact same value hand as somebody with an AJ942
    flush in clubs.  Even though both hands are unique, they still
    hold the identical value, and would therefore "tie" in poker games.
    <p />
    Here's another way to look at it.
    Suppose you were able to round up 2,598,960
    of your friends on a football field, and you gave each of them one
    of the unique 2,598,960 poker hands to hold.  You then yell in a loud voice,
    asking everyone to compare their hand with everybody else's
    hand.  (This will take some time, of <nobr>course :)</nobr>
    Anyway, once they are done, you ask the person holding the best hand to step forward.
    Of course, four people will step forward, each holding a Royal
    Flush in each of the four suits.  They all "tied" for having the
    best hand.  You group those people together, tie a rope around
    them, label them with the number "1", and ask them to leave the
    field.  Now, you ask your friends to compare hands again and figure
    out who has the best hand now.  This time, four more people come
    forward, each holding a King-High Straight Flush.  You group them
    together, label them with a "2", and escort them off the field.
    You keep repeating this process of finding out who has the highest
    hand and marking them with the next number.  The next eight queries
    should yield:
    <ul>
        <font color="#ffff00">
            <li>3: four people holding Queen-High Straight Flushes
            <li>4: four people holding Jack-High Straight Flushes
            <li>5: four people holding Ten-High Straight Flushes
            <li>6: four people holding Nine-High Straight Flushes
            <li>7: four people holding Eight-High Straight Flushes
            <li>8: four people holding Seven-High Straight Flushes
            <li>9: four people holding Six-High Straight Flushes
            <li>10: four people holding Five-High Straight Flushes
        </font>
    </ul>
    Now, when you query for the eleventh time, four people should step
    forward, each holding Four Aces with a King kicker.  Then, Four
    Aces with a Queen kicker.  Then, Four Aces with a Jack kicker.
    And so on, until we have Four Aces with a Deuce kicker.  Next comes
    Four Kings with an Ace kicker.  This continues until we finally
    get down to Four Deuces with a Trey kicker.
    <ul>
        <font color="#ffff00">
            <li>11: four people holding Four Aces with a King kicker
            <li>12: four people holding Four Aces with a Queen kicker
            <li>...
            <li>165: four people holding Four Deuces with a Four kicker
            <li>166: four people holding Four Deuces with a Trey kicker
        </font>
    </ul>
    Next, for the 167<u>th</u> query, we find twenty-four people coming
    forward, each holding a Full House of Aces over Kings.  Then
    24 people with Aces over Queens.  And so on, for the remaining
    Full House hands.
    <ul>
        <font color="#ffff00">
            <li>167: twenty-four people holding Full Houses of Aces over Kings
            <li>168: twenty-four people holding Full Houses of Aces over Queens
            <li>...
            <li>321: twenty-four people holding Full Houses of Deuces over Fours
            <li>322: twenty-four people holding Full Houses of Deuces over Treys
        </font>
    </ul>
    Note that by using combinatorics, we can verify these totals.  Assume
    you have a Full House of Aces over Kings.  There are <font color=yellow>
        <tt>C(4,3)
    </font></tt> possible ways to select three Aces out of a
    possible four, and <font color=yellow><tt>C(4,2)</font></tt> possible
    ways to choose two Kings out of a possible four.  This yields 4 x 6,
    or 24 possible combinations of such hands.
    <p />
    For query #323, four people will step foward, each holding
    a <tt>AKQJ9</tt> Flush.  Then, four people holding <tt>AKQJ8</tt>
    Flushes, and so forth.
    <ul>
        <font color="#ffff00">
            <li>323: four people holding AKQJ9 Flushes
            <li>324: four people holding AKQJ8 Flushes
            <li>...
            <li>1598: four people holding 76432 Flushes
            <li>1599: four people holding 75432 Flushes
        </font>
    </ul>
    For our next query, we get a whopping 1020 people step forward with
    Ace High Straights.  This is followed by another 1020 people with
    King High Straights, and so on down the line.
    <ul>
        <font color="#ffff00">
            <li>1600: 1,020 people holding Ace High Straights
            <li>1601: 1,020 people holding King High Straights
            <li>...
            <li>1608: 1,020 people holding Six High Straights
            <li>1609: 1,020 people holding Five High Straights
        </font>
    </ul>
    Next comes all the Three of a Kinds, 64 people each.
    <ul>
        <font color="#ffff00">
            <li>1610: sixty-four people holding AAAKQ
            <li>1611: sixty-four people holding AAAKJ
            <li>...
            <li>2466: sixty-four people holding 22253
            <li>2467: sixty-four people holding 22243
        </font>
    </ul>
    Then the people in groups of 144, each holding Two Pair.
    <ul>
        <font color="#ffff00">
            <li>2468: 144 people holding AAKKQ
            <li>2469: 144 people holding AAKKJ
            <li>...
            <li>3324: 144 people holding 33225
            <li>3325: 144 people holding 33224
        </font>
    </ul>
    Almost done!  Next comes the One Pair hands, 384 people each.
    <ul>
        <font color="#ffff00">
            <li>3326: 384 people holding AAKQJ
            <li>3327: 384 people holding AAKQT
            <li>...
            <li>6184: 384 people holding 22643
            <li>6185: 384 people holding 22543
        </font>
    </ul>
    And finally, we have the "dreck" High Card hands, with
    1,020 people per hand.  Notice they are identical to the
    above "Flush" hands, except these are not flushes.
    <ul>
        <font color="#ffff00">
            <li>6186: 1,020 people holding AKQJ9
            <li>6187: 1,020 people holding AKQJ8
            <li>...
            <li>7461: 1,020 people holding 76432
            <li>7462: 1,020 people holding 75432
        </font>
    </ul>
    There!  After enumerating and collapsing all the 2.6 million
    unique five-card poker hands, we wind up with just 7462 distinct
    poker hand values.  That was pretty surprising to me when I
    saw the final total.  If you are interested in seeing a table
    of all 7462 values, you'll find it <a href="http://www.suffecool.net/poker/7462.html">here</a>.

        </table>

    <p />

    Once I determined that there were only 7462 distinct values of
    poker hands, I needed a way to quickly transform each of the
    2,598,960 unique five-card poker hands into its actual value.
    To complicate matters, the algorithm needed to be order independant.
    In other words, if I pass the cards
    <nobr><font size=+1><b>Kd Qs Jc Th 9s</b></font></nobr>
    to my evaluator, it must generate the value 1601.  However, if I change
    the order of the cards in any fashion, it must <i>still</i> return
    the value of 1601.  Mixing up the five cards does not change the
    overall value of the hand.  At first, I thought that I could always
    simply sort the hand first before passing it to the evaluator; but
    sorting takes time, and I didn't want to waste any CPU cycles sorting
    hands.  I needed a method that didn't care what order the five cards
    were given as.
    <p />
    After a lot of thought, I had a brainstorm to use prime numbers.
    I would assign a prime number value to each of the thirteen card
    ranks, in this manner:
    <p />
    <center>
        <table border>
            <tr align=center>
                <td><font color="#ffffff">Rank</font></td>
                <td>Deuce</td>
                <td>Trey</td>
                <td>Four</td>
                <td>Five</td>
                <td>Six</td>
                <td>Seven</td>
                <td>Eight</td>
                <td>Nine</td>
                <td>Ten</td>
                <td>Jack</td>
                <td>Queen</td>
                <td>King</td>
                <td>Ace</td>
            </tr>
            <tr align=center>
                <td><font color="#ffffff">Prime</td>
                <td>2</td>
                <td>3</td>
                <td>5</td>
                <td>7</td>
                <td>11</td>
                <td>13</td>
                <td>17</td>
                <td>19</td>
                <td>23</td>
                <td>29</td>
                <td>31</td>
                <td>37</td>
                <td>41</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </center>
    <p />
    The beauty of this system is that if you <i><b>multiply</b></i> the prime
    values of the rank of each card in your hand, you get a unique
    product, regardless of the order of the five cards.  In my above
    example, the King High Straight hand will <i>always</i>
    generate a product value of 14,535,931.  Since multiplication is one
    of the fastest calculations a computer can make, we have shaved
    hundreds of millseconds off our time had we been forced to sort
    each hand before evaluation.
    <p />
    One last step is required, however, before multiplying our prime
    rank values.  We must first check to see if all five cards are of
    the same suit.  It is extremely important that our evaluator
    realize that the value of a <tt>KQJT9</tt> hand is <i>much</i>
    higher if all the suits are the same.
    <p />
    Okay. At this point, I was ready to start writing some code.
    I decided to use the following bit scheme for a single card,
    where each card is of type <tt><b>integer</b></tt> (and therefore,
    four bytes long).
    <center>
        <font color="#ffff00">
            <p /><tt>
                <b>
                    +--------+--------+--------+--------+<br>
                    |xxx<font color=orange>bbbbb</font>|<font color=orange>bbbbbbbb</font>|cdhs<font color="#00ffff">rrrr</font>|xx<font color="#00ff00">pppppp</font>|<br>
                    +--------+--------+--------+--------+<br>
                    <br>
                    <font color="#00ff00">p = prime number of rank (deuce=2,trey=3,four=5,...,ace=41)</font><br>
                    <font color="#00ffff">r = rank of card (deuce=0,trey=1,four=2,five=3,...,ace=12)</font><br>
                    cdhs = suit of card (bit turned on based on suit of card)<br>
                    <font color=orange>b = bit turned on depending on rank of card</font><br>
                </b>
            </tt>
        </font>
    </center>
    <p />
    Using such a scheme, here are some bit pattern examples:
    <font color="#ffff00">
<pre>
<font color="#00ff00">xxxAKQJT 98765432 CDHSrrrr xxPPPPPP</font>
00001000 00000000 01001011 00100101    King of Diamonds
00000000 00001000 00010011 00000111    Five of Spades
00000010 00000000 10001001 00011101    Jack of Clubs
</pre>
    </font>
    <p />
    Now, for my evaluator function, I would pass in five integers,
    each representing one of the five cards in the hand to evaluate.
    We will label these <tt><b>c1</b></tt> through <tt><b>c5</b></tt>.
    First, we check to see if all the suits are the same.  If so,
    then we have either a <i>Flush</i> (or <i>Straight Flush</i>).
    The quickest way to calculate this is by evaluating this:<font color=yellow>
        <center>
            <pre><b>   c1 AND c2 AND c3 AND c4 AND c5 AND 0xF000
</b></pre>
        </center>
    </font>
    This is bit-wise AND, not a boolean AND, by the way.  If the
    above expression yields a value of zero, then we don't have
    a <i>Flush</i>.  If it is non-zero, then we do.  Assuming we have
    a <i>Flush</i>, I needed a fast way to calculate the hand's actual
    value (i.e.  convert it to a value from 1 to 7462).  Table lookups
    are one of the fastest ways to generate values based on index keys,
    so I used the following coding technique.
    <p />
    First, I do another bitwise OR of all five cards, and then bit shift
    that value 16 bits to the right:<font color=yellow>
        <center>
            <pre><b>   q = (c1 OR c2 OR c3 OR c4 OR c5) >> 16
</b></pre>
        </center>
    </font>
    Note that if we have a <i>Flush</i>, then all five card ranks are
    guaranteed to be unique.  We should have exactly <b><i>five</i></b> bits
    set in our shifted value.  The smallest bit pattern would be
    <tt><b><font color=yellow>0x001F</font></b></tt> (decimal 31), and
    the highest would be
    <tt><b><font color=yellow>0x1F00</font></b></tt> (decimal 7936).
    I created a lookup array containing 7937 elements, and then populated
    it with the correct hand values based on each valid bit pattern.
    Let's call this array <tt><b><font color=yellow>flushes[]</font></b></tt>.
    If you checked the value of
    <tt><b><font color=yellow>flushes[31]</font></b></tt>, you should find
    the value <font color=yellow>9</font>, because <font color=yellow>9</font>
    is the distinct value for a Six-High Straight Flush.  As another
    example, let's say you were holding an <tt>AKQJ9</tt> Flush.  The
    bit pattern for that hand would be
    <tt><b><font color=yellow>0x1E80</font></b></tt>, or decimal 7808.
    This means that
    <tt><b><font color=yellow>flushes[7808]</font></b></tt> should hold
    the value 323, which is the distinct value for AKQJ9 Flushes.
    Obviously, there are a lot of entries in this array that will never
    be accessed.  That is the price of lookup tables.  You gain speed
    in favor of "wasted" space.  However, since the highest distinct
    hand value is 7462, we can make our array up of type <tt><b>short</b></tt>.
    That means, our array will take up only 15874 bytes.  Not very large
    at all.
    <p />
    If we should determine that we do not have <i>Flush</i> or <i>
        Straight Flush
    </i> hand, we move on to tackle <i>Straight</i> and
    <i>High Card</i> hands.  Again, we use a lookup table for speed.
    We create another array, which will we will call
    <tt><b><font color=yellow>unique5[]</font></b></tt>.  We use the
    same index <tt><b><font color=yellow>q</font></b></tt> as the index
    into this new array.  If the value found there is zero, then we
    do not have a <i>Straight</i> or <i>High Card</i> hand.  If it is
    non-zero, then it holds the actual hand's distinct value.  For
    example, a King-High Straight has a bit pattern of
    <tt><b><font color=yellow>0x0F80</font></b></tt>, or decimal
    3968.  This means that
    <tt><b><font color=yellow>unique5[3968]</font></b></tt> should
    hold the value <font color=yellow>1601</font>.  The absolute worst
    poker hand of <tt>75432</tt> (unsuited) would yield
    <tt><b><font color=yellow>unique5[0x002F] = unique5[47]</font></b></tt>,
    or <font color=yellow>7462</font>.
    <p />
    With just two easy calculations and two quick lookups, we have
    eliminated 2574 out of the 7462 possible distinct hand values.
    That's a little over a third of all the hands.  Now it's time
    to use our trick with prime numbers.  We take each card,
    extract its prime number value, and then multiply them all
    together:<font color=yellow>
        <center>
            <pre><b>   q = (c1 AND 0xFF) * (c2 AND 0xFF) * ... * (c5 AND 0xFF)
</b></pre>
        </center>
    </font>
    Again, these are bitwise ANDs.  The resulting values will range
    from the small to the very large.  The smallest value is obtained
    if you hold the hand <font size=+1><b>22223</b></font>
    <i>(four Deuces with a Trey kicker)</i>.
    Multiplying its prime values yields the number 48.  The largest value
    comes with holding <font size=+1><b>AAAAK</b></font>.
    Doing the math, we get 104,553,157
    (41 x 41 x 41 x 41 x 37).  These numbers are way too large to use
    a lookup table, so we must find some other method to convert these
    values to their proper distinct hand value.  Since there are only
    4888 remaining hand values (7462 minus 2574), I decided to use
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm" rel="nofollow">
        binary
        search
    </a> algorithm.  It's fast, with a complexity of O(<i>log n</i>).
    I took the remaining 4888 hands, calculated the prime multiplication
    value for each, placed them in an array, and then sorted it.  When I
    need to find a distinct hand value, after all previous efforts fail,
    I do a binary search, which returns an index.  That index is used
    in a regular array, which holds the remaining distinct values.
    <p />
    That's it!  I coded this algorithm, and ran it against some of the
    other poker evaluators out there, and it beat them all.
    I'm pretty proud of it, and kudos to you if you've actually read this far.

    experiment with.

        <b>LATE BREAKING NEWS!!!</b>  Paul Senzee of Florida decided that he could
        speed up my evaluator by using a pre-computed perfect hash function
        instead of a binary search for those final 4888 hand values.  He
        says he obtained a speedup factor of 2.7x!  Not too shabby!  Anyway,
        you can read about his optimization and download his new evaluator
